# Book-management-system
Based on c and mysql
#Before use this easy system please read this guide
#Before you compile the file ,please make sure you have made changes below
#in the bookmanage.c you will see below #define
#define mysqlip "127.0.0.1"
#define port 3306
#define loginusername "username"
#define loginpassword "password"
#define mysqlname "library"

please must make sure you have changed you own mysql
if you use you local mysql,the default ip is "127.0.0.1",port is 3306
but if you use remote mysql ,please change it
And loginusername and loginpassword are corresponding to  the username and password when you login in you mysql
as me is
mysql -u root -p password
so do not to change it
and also change the databasename 
my databasename is library

as the guide to configure mysql
Please read configure
